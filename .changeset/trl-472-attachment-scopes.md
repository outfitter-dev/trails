Add three attachment scopes for typed layers — trail, surface, topo — with composition order **topo → surface → trail → blaze**. `TrailSpec` and `Trail` gain `layers?: readonly Layer[]` (default `[]`). `topo()` accepts `{ layers: [...] }` as the third options argument; the topo carries those layers and they reach the executor via `ExecuteTrailOptions.topoLayers`. The CLI's `surface()`/`createProgram()`/`deriveCliCommands` already supports a `layers` option; that now flows through `runTrailOnce` as `surfaceLayers`. The executor builds the layer chain `[...topoLayers, ...surfaceLayers, ...trail.layers, ...options.layers]` so topo wraps surface wraps trail wraps blaze (verified by composition-order tests at every level). Survey's `TrailDetailReport` adds `composedLayers: { topo, surface, trail }` so agents can introspect the layer chain per trail. Backward-compatible: every new field is optional with a non-undefined default; existing call sites are unchanged.
