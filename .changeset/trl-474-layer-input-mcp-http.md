Project typed-layer `input` schemas onto MCP and HTTP surfaces. Closes Phase 7. Lifts `collectAttachedTypedLayers` and `projectLayerFieldName` (collision-rename rule) into `@ontrails/core/internal/layer-projection` so all three surfaces share one source of truth. The CLI surface refactors to consume the lifted helpers (no behavior change). MCP merges layer fields into each tool's `inputSchema` and partitions inbound args at invocation time. HTTP merges layer fields into the route's request schema (query for reads, body for writes) and exposes new optional `HttpRouteDefinition.inputSchema` + `layerInputProjections` for surface adapters / OpenAPI generators. Collision rule matches TRL-473's: deterministic rename to a layer-prefixed camelCase name with the original captured in the routing table. Side fix: MCP and HTTP handlers now forward `topoLayers: graph.layers` + `surfaceLayers: layers` so topo-scope layers actually compose at runtime (previously the handlers used the deprecated `layers` alias and never read `graph.layers`).
