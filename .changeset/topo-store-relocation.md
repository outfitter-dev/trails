Relocate the topo-store public API from `@ontrails/core` to `@ontrails/topographer` per ADR-0042. Generic `trails-db` helpers (`openReadTrailsDb`, `openWriteTrailsDb`, `ensureSubsystemSchema`, `deriveTrailsDbPath`, `deriveTrailsDir`) stay in core because tracing and other subsystems share them.

Breaking pre-1.0 beta change. Update consumer imports:

```diff
- import { topoStore, createTopoStore, createMockTopoStore, createTopoSnapshot, listTopoSnapshots, pinTopoSnapshot, unpinTopoSnapshot, createStoredTopoSnapshot, getStoredTopoExport, countTopoSnapshots, countPinnedSnapshots, countPrunableSnapshots, pruneUnpinnedSnapshots } from '@ontrails/core';
+ import { topoStore, createTopoStore, createMockTopoStore, createTopoSnapshot, listTopoSnapshots, pinTopoSnapshot, unpinTopoSnapshot } from '@ontrails/topographer';
+ import { createStoredTopoSnapshot, getStoredTopoExport, countTopoSnapshots, countPinnedSnapshots, countPrunableSnapshots, pruneUnpinnedSnapshots } from '@ontrails/topographer/backend-support';
```

The same root move applies to types `ReadOnlyTopoStore`, `MockTopoStoreSeed`, `TopoSnapshot`, `TopoStoreRef`, `TopoStoreExportRecord`, `TopoStoreResourceRecord`, `TopoStoreTrailRecord`, `TopoStoreTrailDetailRecord`, `CreateTopoSnapshotInput`, and `ListTopoSnapshotsOptions`. The direct DB helper type `StoredTopoExport` moves to `@ontrails/topographer/backend-support`.

Core newly exports `activationSourceKey`, `projectActivationSourceDeclaration`, `activationSourceDeclarationSignature`, and the `ActivationSourceProjection` type — these were already used internally and are now part of the public surface so `@ontrails/topographer` (the only consumer that needs them) can import them through normal package channels.
