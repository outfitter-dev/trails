Add `--permit '<json>'` to inject an inline permit on `trails run`. New `permitPreset()` exposes a `--permit` string flag that the CLI build parses and validates against the `BasePermit` shape (`{ id: string, scopes: string[] }`) using a small Zod schema. Valid permits flow through `ExecuteTrailOptions.permit` → `applyContextOverrides` → `ctx.permit` so existing `enforcePermitRequirement` behavior just sees a populated permit. Invalid JSON or schema mismatch surface as `Result.err(ValidationError)` (exit code 1) before the trail runs, avoiding spurious `PermitError` results from malformed input. The flag is global, never routed into trail input (added to `META_FLAG_CANDIDATES`), and overlays only when defined.

Topographer now projects permit requirements into surface-map entries and classifies permit-tightening diffs as breaking when new scopes are required.
