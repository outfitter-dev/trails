Split `trails survey` detail inspection into role-anchored `survey.trail`, `survey.resource`, and `survey.signal` trails while keeping bare `survey <id>` as an all-kinds lookup. Remove the temporary `survey --openapi` and `topo.show` CLI shapes. CLI command projection now supports executable parent commands with positional arguments alongside child commands.
