Define the Warden fix-metadata contract (`WardenFix`, `WardenFixCapability`, `WardenFixClass`, `WardenFixSafety`, `WardenFixEdit`) with optional `fix` metadata on diagnostics and rule metadata, projected through the guide, manifest, markdown, and agent guidance. Export `wardenFixClasses`/`wardenFixSafeties` value arrays and surface the rule `fix` capability in the `warden.guide` trail output schema. Dormant until a rule declares it.
