### 2026-04-13 Contour symbol-tagging approach

**Question:** Should `contour()` symbol-tag Zod schemas with `Object.defineProperty`, or use a WeakMap for tracking contour-schema associations?
**Decision:** Symbol-tagging is correct. `configurable: true` is already set. No change to the approach.
**Basis:** Tenets — "reduce ceremony, not clarity" and information architecture (projected data travels with the authored artifact). WeakMap would couple projection to a specific lookup table, requiring it to be passed everywhere.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** WeakMap keyed by schema object — rejected because it breaks the projection-travels-with-schema property.

### 2026-04-13 Cross-contour auto-registration in topo

**Question:** Should `topo()` transitively walk contour field references and auto-register dependencies?
**Decision:** No. Explicit registration with warden enforcement. The warden `contour-exists` rule should cover transitive references from `getContourReferences`.
**Basis:** Drift guard hierarchy — warden-time safety (level 4) is the right level. Auto-registration creates invisible graph expansion that contradicts "the resolved graph is the story."
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Transitive walk — rejected because it imports primitives the developer didn't explicitly declare.

### 2026-04-13 Resource NotFoundError should be InternalError

**Question:** Should `wrapUnexpected` distinguish domain vs infrastructure errors, or should `resource.from(ctx)` throw a different error class?
**Decision:** Fix in `createResourceLookup`: change `NotFoundError` to `InternalError`. Leave `wrapUnexpected` unchanged.
**Basis:** Error taxonomy tenet — `NotFoundError` is domain-level (user asked for something that doesn't exist). Missing resource in context is infrastructure misconfiguration, which is `InternalError`.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Adding domain/infrastructure distinction to `wrapUnexpected` — rejected because it requires call-site awareness in a context-free function.

### 2026-04-13 ADR-0033 detour warden rule language

**Question:** Should ADR-0033's language about the warden rule be softened, or should the rule be required in the detour runtime PR?
**Decision:** Soften to "planned alongside the runtime; should ship before detours are considered stable." File a P1 Linear issue for the unreachable-detour warden rule.
**Basis:** ADRs are human-readable contracts — a promise of co-shipment that isn't honored is a lie. But blocking the reconcile factory refactor is the wrong tradeoff.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Requiring the rule in the same PR — rejected because it blocks the primary motivation for the ADR.

### 2026-04-16 `pattern` as metadata, not a callable primitive (TRL-300)

**Question:** Should factory-produced trail shapes introduce a dedicated `pattern` primitive (callable namespace like `pattern.crud(...)`), or keep `pattern` as metadata?
**Decision:** No dedicated primitive. `pattern?: string` is an open-string field on `TrailSpec`. Factories stamp the label; `deriveTrail()` does not. Hand-authorable. Extensible by connectors and community packages without a registry.
**Basis:** Tenets evaluation hierarchy — strengthen existing primitives before introducing new ones. `deriveTrail()` + factories + a real field close the drift guard without adding primitives. The callable-namespace proposal's wins (visible link, warden leverage) are marginal or already satisfied by AST-scans. Its costs — cross-package composition, registry module-load-order, case-of-one rule — are substantial. An open-string field serves the "connectors contribute patterns" vision better than a namespaced registry, which would structurally fight connector extensibility.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:**

- Status quo (vocabulary-only, no field) — rejected because the ADR-0032 claim that pattern metadata is set automatically is then permanently untrue.
- Callable primitive namespace `pattern.crud(...)` — rejected on structural grounds (gist §8b/§8c/§8e; cross-package composition complexity; case-of-one rule).
- Inferred pattern (no field; reconstruct from provenance) — rejected because the contract should be queryable directly on the trail, not reconstructed.
**Follow-up:** TRL-301 adds the field and stamps the four shipped factories (`crud`, `sync`, `reconcile`, `ingest`); amends ADR-0032 to correct the two untrue claims and capture the "factory owns the label" / "connector-extensible" framing.
