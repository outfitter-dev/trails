### 2026-04-13 Contour symbol-tagging approach

**Question:** Should `contour()` symbol-tag Zod schemas with `Object.defineProperty`, or use a WeakMap for tracking contour-schema associations?
**Decision:** Symbol-tagging is correct. `configurable: true` is already set. No change to the approach.
**Basis:** Tenets — "reduce ceremony, not clarity" and information architecture (projected data travels with the authored artifact). WeakMap would couple projection to a specific lookup table, requiring it to be passed everywhere.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** WeakMap keyed by schema object — rejected because it breaks the projection-travels-with-schema property.

### 2026-04-13 Cross-contour auto-registration in topo

**Question:** Should `topo()` transitively walk contour field references and auto-register dependencies?
**Decision:** No. Explicit registration with warden enforcement. The warden `contour-exists` rule should cover transitive references from `getContourReferences`.
**Basis:** Drift guard hierarchy — warden-time safety (level 4) is the right level. Auto-registration creates invisible graph expansion that contradicts "the resolved graph is the story."
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Transitive walk — rejected because it imports primitives the developer didn't explicitly declare.

### 2026-04-13 Resource NotFoundError should be InternalError

**Question:** Should `wrapUnexpected` distinguish domain vs infrastructure errors, or should `resource.from(ctx)` throw a different error class?
**Decision:** Fix in `createResourceLookup`: change `NotFoundError` to `InternalError`. Leave `wrapUnexpected` unchanged.
**Basis:** Error taxonomy tenet — `NotFoundError` is domain-level (user asked for something that doesn't exist). Missing resource in context is infrastructure misconfiguration, which is `InternalError`.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Adding domain/infrastructure distinction to `wrapUnexpected` — rejected because it requires call-site awareness in a context-free function.

### 2026-04-13 ADR-0033 detour warden rule language

**Question:** Should ADR-0033's language about the warden rule be softened, or should the rule be required in the detour runtime PR?
**Decision:** Soften to "planned alongside the runtime; should ship before detours are considered stable." File a P1 Linear issue for the unreachable-detour warden rule.
**Basis:** ADRs are human-readable contracts — a promise of co-shipment that isn't honored is a lie. But blocking the reconcile factory refactor is the wrong tradeoff.
**Confidence:** High
**Alternatives considered:** Requiring the rule in the same PR — rejected because it blocks the primary motivation for the ADR.
