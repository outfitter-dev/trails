# Trails Architecture Documentation

## Protocol-Based Refactor Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive architecture documentation for refactoring Trails to a protocol-based architecture inspired by OpenAI Codex.

### Documents

1. **[Protocol-Based Architecture Refactor](./protocol-based-refactor.md)**
   - Main architecture document
   - Core protocol design
   - Implementation plan
   - Migration strategy
   
2. **[Security & Enhancement Addendum](./protocol-refactor-addendum.md)**
   - Security implementation
   - Resilience patterns
   - Advanced features
   - Production considerations

### Reading Order

1. Start with the main architecture document to understand the overall design
2. Review the addendum for critical security and operational enhancements
3. Use both documents together during implementation

### Quick Links

- [Protocol Design](./protocol-based-refactor.md#protocol-design)
- [Implementation Plan](./protocol-based-refactor.md#implementation-plan)
- [Security Layer](./protocol-refactor-addendum.md#1-security-layer)
- [Testing Strategy](./protocol-based-refactor.md#testing-strategy)

### Purpose

These documents provide a complete blueprint for transforming Trails from a tightly-coupled UI+backend system into a clean, protocol-based architecture that:

- Separates UI concerns from business logic
- Enables multiple UI implementations
- Improves testability and maintainability
- Follows 2025 Go best practices
- Includes production-ready security and operations

The architecture is designed to be implemented in phases over 8 weeks, with security foundations established first.
