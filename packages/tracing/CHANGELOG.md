# @ontrails/tracing

## 1.0.0-beta.17

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3dc8254]
  - @ontrails/core@1.0.0-beta.17

## 1.0.0-beta.16

### Major Changes

- 578e674: BREAKING: rename the OpenTelemetry tracing connector API to adapter vocabulary.

  - `createOtelConnector` -> `createOtelAdapter`
  - `OtelConnectorOptions` -> `OtelAdapterOptions`

  The `@ontrails/tracing/otel` subpath is unchanged. The internal OTel source path
  moves from `src/connectors/otel.ts` to `src/adapters/otel.ts`.

- 10eae9a: Migrate the Trails workspace to the documented `.trails/` layout: committed `.lock` files at the workspace root, ignored `cache/` for rebuildable derived data, ignored `state/` for mutable runtime state, and `.trails/config.local.{ts,js}` for local overrides. The default SQLite path is now `.trails/state/trails.db`. Workspace bootstrap creates only `cache/` and `state/` — the legacy `dev/` and `generated/` subdirectories are no longer created. Dev reset cleans both the new `.trails/state/` paths and legacy `.trails/trails.db*` and `.trails/dev/tracing.db*` paths for one cycle. Scaffold and workspace gitignores reflect the new layout.

  Workspace bootstrap is now owned by a single canonical source in `@ontrails/core`. The package exposes `ensureTrailsWorkspace()`, `WORKSPACE_GITIGNORE_CONTENT`, and `WORKSPACE_GITIGNORE_LINES`. `@ontrails/config` no longer exports its own `ensureWorkspace` (consumers should import from `@ontrails/core`). `trails create` now writes `.trails/.gitignore` during scaffolding so a fresh-scaffolded project's initial commit includes the workspace gitignore (resolves TRL-703).

### Minor Changes

- 4b8d13b: **BREAKING:** Complete the tracing wire-format cutover from `trailhead` to `surface`.

  - OTel attributes now use `trails.surface` instead of `trails.trailhead`.
  - The SQLite dev-store schema now writes the `surface` column instead of `trailhead`.
  - `tracing.query` records now expose `surface` instead of `trailhead`.
  - The legacy `.trails/dev/tracing.db` migration bridge has been removed; reset local dev stores before upgrading.

  See `docs/migration/trailhead-to-surface.md` for the full migration map.

- 22c6c06: Accept ADR-0041 Unified Observability and ship the first activation and
  observability primitives it depends on: activation trace records, topo-level
  observe configuration, webhook activation materialization, signal/webhook
  warden coaching, the `@ontrails/observe` package, sink composition, and
  zero-dependency observe sinks.

### Patch Changes

- e898cc4: Add repo-level Knip dead-code detection and remove stale internal exports and unused package dependencies surfaced by the new check.
- a8997ed: Add migration guidance for the retired `@ontrails/logging` package and align observability README examples around `@ontrails/observe`, `@ontrails/tracing`, and `@ontrails/logtape`.
- fe03945: Document the v1 observability package boundary: `@ontrails/observe` is the production sink contract package, while `@ontrails/tracing` remains the compatibility and developer-state package with the supported `@ontrails/tracing/otel` adapter subpath.
- d40430d: Remove the retired `@ontrails/logging` workspace from the prerelease package set. Use `@ontrails/observe` for log and trace sink contracts and `@ontrails/logtape` for LogTape forwarding.

## 1.0.0-beta.15

### Minor Changes

- 4ad6b25: Lexicon rename cleanup (ADR-0023). Breaking for `@ontrails/core`, `@ontrails/cli`, and `@ontrails/tracing` at the boundary; internal-only churn for `@ontrails/warden`.

  - **core**: the topo store schema renames `topo_provisions` / `topo_trail_provisions` → `topo_resources` / `topo_trail_resources` and `provision_count` → `resource_count`. Schema version bumped v4→v5. Stores still carrying the legacy schema are detected on open, dropped, and recreated from the new DDL — previous topo saves are cleared. Stored-data helpers `listTopoStoreProvisions` / `getTopoStoreProvision` / `readProvisionUsage` / `mapProvisionRow` renamed to their `resource` counterparts. TS row types `TopoTrailProvisionRow` / `TopoProvisionRow` renamed to `TopoTrailResourceRow` / `TopoResourceRow`.
  - **cli**: CLI output mode env vars are now derived from the topo name per ADR-0023. Legacy globals `TRAILS_JSON` / `TRAILS_JSONL` are no longer honored — a topo named `stash` reads `STASH_JSON` / `STASH_JSONL`. `ActionResultContext` gains a `topoName: string` field; `resolveOutputMode(flags, topoName)` takes a topo name argument.
  - **tracing**: legacy `.trails/dev/tracker.db` migration path removed. Any user still running a pre-rename beta build with a `tracker.db` should delete it or migrate before upgrading.
  - **warden**: internal-only rename of `provisionDeclarations` / `provisionExists` rules and their trails to `resourceDeclarations` / `resourceExists`. No behavior change.

## 1.0.0-beta.14

### Minor Changes

- 69057e9: Add hierarchical CLI command trees and structured input, enforce established-only topo exports across trailheads, move developer topo and tracker state onto shared `trails.db` with pins and maintenance flows, and ship schema-derived stores through `@ontrails/store` and its Drizzle runtime.

## 1.0.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- 6944147: Complete trifecta for config, permits, and tracker (formerly tracks)

  - **config**: Add `configProvision`, `configGate`, `config.trail`, and `config.workspace` trails with full `defineConfig`, `resolve`, `describe`, `explain`, `doctor`, and code generation support
  - **permits**: Add `authService` and `auth.verify` trail for runtime authorization checks
  - **tracker**: Rename tracks to tracker; add `trackerProvision` and `tracker.status` trail for structured signal tracking
  - **cli**: Fix build flag handling and improve bootstrap scaffolding
  - **testing**: Expand test context helpers and example-based testing utilities
  - **core/mcp/http**: Internal alignment for provision and composition updates

- Trail-native vocabulary cutover. Breaking API field renames across all packages:

  - Trail spec: `run:` → `blaze:`, `follow:` → `crosses:`, `services:` → `provisions:`, `metadata:` → `meta:`, `emits:` → `signals:`
  - Runtime: `ctx.follow()` → `ctx.cross()`, `ctx.emit()` → `ctx.signal()`, `ctx.signal` (abort) → `ctx.abortSignal`
  - Entry points: `blaze(app)` → `trailhead(app)`
  - Package rename: `@ontrails/crumbs` → `@ontrails/tracker`
  - Wrapper types: `Layer` → `Gate`, `layers`/`middleware` → `gates`
  - Transport: `surface` → `trailhead`, `adapter` → `connector`
