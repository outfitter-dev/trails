# @ontrails/mcp

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`93607de`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/93607deae7f5a6badb4fed40f9f6b7fef43c8b64): API simplification: unified trail model, intent enum, blaze, metadata.

  **BREAKING CHANGES:**

  - `hike()` removed — use `trail()` with optional `crosses: [...]` field
  - `follows` renamed to `crosses` (matching `ctx.cross()`)
  - `topo.hikes` removed — single `topo.trails` map
  - `kind: 'hike'` removed — everything is `kind: 'trail'`
  - `readOnly`/`destructive` booleans replaced by `intent: 'read' | 'write' | 'destroy'`
  - `implementation` field renamed to `blaze`
  - `markers` field renamed to `metadata`
  - `testHike` renamed to `testCrosses`, `HikeScenario` to `CrossScenario`
  - `surface()` now returns the surface handle (`Command` for CLI, `Server` for MCP)

### Minor Changes

- [`69057e9`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/69057e9348006b2b70c9f6237572a5aa8de3ee1f): Add hierarchical CLI command trees and structured input, enforce established-only topo exports across surfaces, move developer topo and tracing state onto shared `trails.db` with pins and maintenance flows, and ship schema-derived stores through `@ontrails/store` and its Drizzle runtime.
- [`ebbf0c5`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/ebbf0c538550429f92944ac2d196b6bc9ca00c4b): Consolidated improvements across all surface packages.

  **core**: Add `TrailResult<T>` utility type, `topo.ids()` and `topo.count` accessors, `dispatch()` for headless trail execution, and extract shared `executeTrail` pipeline used by CLI/MCP/HTTP.

  **http**: Detect route path collisions and return `Result` from `buildHttpRoutes()`, wire request `AbortSignal` through to trail context, and make write → POST mapping explicit in intent-to-method lookup.

  **mcp**: Return `Result` from `buildMcpTools()` on collision instead of throwing.

  **cli**: Verify exception catching via centralized `executeTrail`.

  **testing**: Follow context awareness improvements.

  **warden**: Refactor rules as composable trails with examples.

  **schema**: Error code and empty body fixes.

- [`39ecab9`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/39ecab9940ad8255215c25b9db55047180828457): Bug fixes across all surface packages found via parallel Codex review.

  **core**: Fix Result.toJson false circular detection on DAGs, deserializeError subclass round-trip, topo cross-kind ID collisions, validateTopo multi-node cycle detection, error example input validation bypass, and deriveFields array type collapse.

  **cli**: Switch the CLI surface to parseAsync for proper async error handling, add boolean flag negation (--no-flag), and strict number parsing that rejects partial input.

  **mcp**: Align BlobRef with core (including ReadableStream support) and detect tool-name collisions after normalization.

  **testing**: Include trails in testContracts validation, with cross-context awareness.

  **warden**: Collect trail detour targets, validate detour refs in trail specs, and stop implementation-returns-result from walking into nested function bodies.

- [`f2a7857`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/f2a785777ba9cb2d540c0fd79c80b43d4cb934d3): Initial v1 beta release of the Trails framework.

  - **@ontrails/core** — Result type, error taxonomy, trail/signal/topo, validateTopo, validateInput/Output, deriveFields, patterns, redaction, branded types, resilience
  - **@ontrails/cli** — CLI command model, flag derivation, output formatting
  - **@ontrails/mcp** — MCP surface, tool generation, annotations, progress bridge
  - **@ontrails/testing** — testAll, testExamples, testTrail, testCrosses, testContracts, testDetours, surface harnesses
  - **@ontrails/warden** — AST-based code convention rules via oxc-parser, drift detection, CI formatters
  - **@ontrails/topographer** — Surface map generation, hashing, semantic diffing, lock helpers

- [`5adb995`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/5adb99551c2dda6190d46cce7f60bb08d63c99aa): Complete the v1 hard cutover from the authored `blaze` field to
  `implementation` across trail contracts, surface projections, tests, examples,
  and public source-analysis helpers. Existing applications must rename authored
  trail behavior fields and direct trail-object access before upgrading.
- [`88a6a62`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/88a6a62a9e9e230ca6d368fa78dc3ece6c816204): Complete the v1 classification-first cutover from projection/project vocabulary
  to derive/derived for contract-owned fact production and render/rendered for
  surface presentation. Public type, helper, rule, relation, and report names move
  without compatibility aliases; ordinary repository/project nouns remain
  explicit preserves or structured review inventory.
- [`26f9ffd`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/26f9ffd7f168fc3c45a1a57d5315902f41963a2e): Project typed-layer `input` schemas onto MCP and HTTP surfaces. Closes Phase 7. Lifts `collectAttachedTypedLayers` and `projectLayerFieldName` (collision-rename rule) into `@ontrails/core/internal/layer-projection` so all three surfaces share one source of truth. The CLI surface refactors to consume the lifted helpers (no behavior change). MCP merges layer fields into each tool's `inputSchema` and partitions inbound args at invocation time. HTTP merges layer fields into the route's request schema (query for reads, body for writes) and exposes new optional `HttpRouteDefinition.inputSchema` + `layerInputProjections` for surface adapters / OpenAPI generators. Collision rule matches TRL-473's: deterministic rename to a layer-prefixed camelCase name with the original captured in the routing table. Side fix: MCP and HTTP handlers now forward `topoLayers: graph.layers` + `surfaceLayers: layers` so topo-scope layers actually compose at runtime (previously the handlers used the deprecated `layers` alias and never read `graph.layers`).
- [`accb9ec`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/accb9ec5929cb8aefba7c350c2ece3414e28e777): Add MCP surface facets, MCP resource projection for cold context, and deferred-loading metadata hints.
- [`fde5516`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/fde5516ad396faa718936b10ff658b3ade3383b9): Trail-native vocabulary cutover. Breaking API field renames across all packages:

  - Trail spec: `run:` → `blaze:`, `follow:` → `crosses:`, `services:` → `resources:`, `metadata:` → `meta:`, `emits:` → `fires:`
  - Runtime: `ctx.follow()` → `ctx.cross()`, `ctx.emit()` → `ctx.fire()`, `ctx.signal` (abort) → `ctx.abortSignal`
  - Entry points: `trailhead(app)` → `surface(app)`
  - Package rename: `@ontrails/crumbs` / `@ontrails/tracker` → `@ontrails/tracing`
  - Wrapper types: retired gate/middleware vocabulary in favor of `Layer` and `layers`
  - Package taxonomy: retired connector vocabulary in favor of adapters

### Patch Changes

- [`e41c382`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/e41c3829c2d692683b78c730e67fd5b17ac0ff4e): Document beta-channel install guidance in package and adapter README install snippets so consumers use explicit `@beta` (or pinned `1.0.0-beta.N`) tags instead of accidental `latest` resolution during the prerelease line. Adds the policy doc at `docs/releases/beta-channel-policy.md`, prints both `latest` and `beta` dist-tags in `bun run publish:registry-check`, and aligns plugin/skill install snippets.
- [`da6e2ca`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/da6e2caeb06f150042148f10f03a6a9dae5648d1): Cleanup and hardening pass across all packages.

  **core**: Deduplicate `DispatchOptions` as type alias of `ExecuteTrailOptions`. Replace `TrailContext` index signature with typed `extensions` field for type safety. Deep-merge `extensions` in `executeTrail` context resolution. Remove unused surface-map type plus legacy `connectors.ts`, `health.ts`, and `job.ts` proof-of-concept files from the published package.

  **cli**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `surface()` with opt-out via `validate: false`.

  **http**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `surface()` with opt-out.

  **mcp**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `surface()` with opt-out.

  **warden**: Project-aware rule context preserved in trail wrappers.

- [`6944147`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/694414712949a1107235684a2492ac982ed39a20): Complete trifecta for config, permits, and tracker (formerly tracks)

  - **config**: Add `configResource`, `config.trail`, and `config.workspace` trails with full `defineConfig`, `resolve`, `describe`, `explain`, `doctor`, and code generation support
  - **permits**: Add `authResource` and `auth.verify` trail for runtime authorization checks
  - **tracing**: Rename tracks to tracing; add `tracingResource` and `tracing.status` trail for structured signal tracking
  - **cli**: Fix build flag handling and improve bootstrap scaffolding
  - **testing**: Expand test context helpers and example-based testing utilities
  - **core/mcp/http**: Internal alignment for resource and composition updates

- [`1eb5bdc`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/1eb5bdc06142d8886f3870801b2ef71a0c5f3844): Rename first-class trail composition from the `cross` API family to the `compose` family across core contracts, testing helpers, topo projections, Warden rules, CLI scaffolds, and docs. `composes`, `ctx.compose`, `composeInput`, and `Compose*` type names are now the public authoring vocabulary; topo persistence migrates legacy composition rows and graph keys forward.
- [`6300f70`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/6300f709bb6dffc0e6cc82479fe8d0204c52bbba): Refresh source comments and test labels for retired connector terminology as adapter guardrails become strict.
- [`20d7a5c`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/20d7a5c8e675fd3ecd8c29441bbd8a99b5c64ed0): Enforce the shared safe error projection policy for public error bodies, diagnostics, serialized payloads, and CLI stderr.
- [`7065b55`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/7065b55568dced6df9f8687288842cdbbfd7f6e4): Fix two blocking bugs from real-world migration:

  - Published packages now resolve correctly (workspace:^ instead of workspace:\*)
  - Error forwarding works across different success types (Err no longer carries phantom T)

- [`42a87c1`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/42a87c1b8691c2fad94ba45175b6eec0219f4594): Fix workspace dependency resolution in published packages. Now using bun publish
  which correctly replaces workspace:^ with actual version numbers.
- [`8638dae`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/8638dae66b4003d311f3399b8b830e5b9434c774): Add a public API example for MCP `deriveAnnotations` annotation derivation.
- [`8638dae`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/8638dae66b4003d311f3399b8b830e5b9434c774): Add public API examples for the MCP tool metadata keys.
- [`81373bc`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/81373bc5e980bb06d56fb06af4f0986f72e318c7): Wave-2 MCP cutover to the app-authored `surfaces` overlay. The overlay's `mcp` bindings are now the authored, lockable default for the MCP surface: a list binding derives one grouped trailhead tool (member selection in `{ trail, input }`, member identity preserved in `{ trail, output }`, deterministic derived description), and a scalar binding derives an additional tool synonym whose MCP-safe name is published verbatim and must expand to exactly one trail. `deriveMcpTools`/`createServer` accept the new `overlays` option; `@ontrails/core` gains `expandMcpSurfaceBindings` and `deriveMcpTrailheadDescription`.

  The call-site `CreateServerOptions.trailheads` map survives as permanent override-in-context design, not a compatibility bridge: when both channels are present, the call-site map wins at runtime. Warden's new `trailhead-override-divergence` rule (warn) names both sides when a call-site map's binding names or member selectors diverge from the authored overlay default.

  Topographer now derives `graph.trailheads` from the overlay's `mcp` list bindings in both `deriveTopoGraph` and the store-side graph build, so trailhead facts flow from compiled locks into Wayfinder reads for the first time. The never-wired `DeriveTopoGraphOptions.trailheads` option and the `TopoGraphTrailheadDeclaration`/`TopoGraphTrailheadTrailSelector` types are removed — a beta-window hard cutover of an option no caller could reach; author the equivalent `mcp` list binding in `surfaceOverlay({ mcp })` instead.

- [`8638dae`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/8638dae66b4003d311f3399b8b830e5b9434c774): Add a public API example for the MCP progress callback bridge.
- [`ee9f3ae`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/ee9f3ae0c1f42e371bae6568c00bbdfccb4da677): Let Warden fix capabilities declare downstream scan targets and have Regrade
  honor those targets for Warden-backed term-rewrite classes.

  Dogfood the first safe facet-to-trailhead prose rewrite through project-local
  Warden rules and Regrade.

- [`00f7093`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/00f7093132a50c49b7bc2dcf9eef98f9424fd2e0): Add resources as a first-class primitive.

  Resources make infrastructure dependencies declarative, injectable, and governable. Define a resource with `resource()`, declare it on a trail with `resources: [db]`, and access it with `db.from(ctx)` or `ctx.resource()`.

  **Core:** `resource()` factory, `ResourceSpec<T>`, `ResourceContext`, singleton resolution in `executeTrail`, in-flight creation dedup, `isResource` guard, `findDuplicateResourceId`, topo resource discovery and validation, `resources` field on trail specs.

  **Testing:** Auto-resolution of `mock` factories in `testAll`, `testExamples`, `testContracts`, and `testCrosses`. Explicit `resources` overrides with correct precedence (`explicit > ctx.extensions > auto-mock`). Resource mock propagation through cross graphs.

  **Warden:** `resource-declarations` rule validates `db.from(ctx)` and `ctx.resource()` usage matches declared `resources: [...]`. `resource-exists` rule validates declared resource IDs resolve in project context. Scope-aware AST walking skips nested function boundaries.

  **Surfaces:** Resource overrides thread through the CLI, MCP, and HTTP surfaces.

  **Introspection:** Survey and surface map outputs include resource graph. Topo exposes `.resources`, `.getResource()`, `.hasResource()`, `.listResources()`, `.resourceIds()`, `.resourceCount`.

  **Docs:** ADR-009 accepted. Unified resource guide, updated vocabulary, getting-started, architecture, and package READMEs.

- [`a9fdbc7`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/a9fdbc7769be77e1ee63d89a4a25d17b9f29d8ed): Clarify surface accommodation doctrine in MCP surface facet metadata and Warden trail-fork coaching guidance.
- [`820b4ad`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/820b4ad9c40ea383b3c489a05fe7e4b2328e324f): Add `surfaceOverlay` — the shared surface-naming schema (scalar binding = synonym, list binding = grouped entry, singleton list stays a group) with app-authored/adapter-derived overlay provenance enforced at collection and consumption, and the `surface-overlay-coherence` Warden rule. MCP tool-name derivation moves to `@ontrails/core` (`deriveMcpToolName`) so the surface and governance read one projection; `@ontrails/mcp`'s `deriveToolName` now delegates to it. The coherence rule activates on standard warden runs once fresh derivations collect app-module overlays through the shared compile channel (TRL-1209, next in this stack).
- [`49c2e7d`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/49c2e7d5c7c063b9aa6abee1d2932bf3003133cc): Refresh published package README taxonomy to use adapter language instead of retired connector vocabulary.

- [`6e63e48`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/6e63e483617b84cb6868d0c4d58d5b5a8d3b9ed2): Complete the v1 grouped surface-entry vocabulary cutover from facet to trailhead, including Regrade dogfood support for governed string literal renames and composed AST rewrite application.
- [`84f56a5`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/84f56a5b97e9fed3d673e87da8eebdd916390449): Project live trail-version metadata on CLI, HTTP, and MCP surfaces and thread explicit surface version selection into shared trail execution.
- [`b1fbe57`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/b1fbe574e6f44d1fecb5e3a000270955c0a77b7b): Publish Bun-validated package tarballs through an npm trusted-publishing adapter
  binding, add exact repository metadata for each public workspace package, and
  correct the native Bun release descriptor to its pack-only runtime boundary.
- [`5d88104`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/5d88104c6c269e2ef1e92ba3b9e09a410df10c7b): Polish Trails blaze terminology across package docs and Warden guidance.
- [`9bec01c`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/9bec01c620a36202586edad2fb887a9869aab875): Document MCP resource projection and deferred-loading options for cold surface context.
- [`61497c5`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/61497c54deaaae2d067af88d0be6db0a5acb5faf): Add v1-minimum public API examples for shipped surface entrypoints.
- [`df13faf`](https://github.com/outfitter-dev/trails/commit/df13faf0c2cb55804bdfeb65abcea1570efb4c61): Tighten Wayfinder navigation review findings: carry adapter filters into included adapter facts, keep live-source outline off the operator MCP surface until host-root binding exists, make unknown MCP resources protocol errors, route secondary Wayfinder graph populations through unified flags, and keep undeclared string `ctx.compose()` calls as Warden errors.

- 8638dae: Add public API examples for the MCP tool metadata keys.
- 8638dae: Add a public API example for the MCP progress callback bridge.
- 84f56a5: Project live trail-version metadata on CLI, HTTP, and MCP surfaces and thread explicit surface version selection into shared trail execution.
- 5d88104: Polish Trails blaze terminology across package docs and Warden guidance.

## 1.0.0-beta.16

### Minor Changes

- 26f9ffd: Project typed-layer `input` schemas onto MCP and HTTP surfaces. Closes Phase 7. Lifts `collectAttachedTypedLayers` and `projectLayerFieldName` (collision-rename rule) into `@ontrails/core/internal/layer-projection` so all three surfaces share one source of truth. The CLI surface refactors to consume the lifted helpers (no behavior change). MCP merges layer fields into each tool's `inputSchema` and partitions inbound args at invocation time. HTTP merges layer fields into the route's request schema (query for reads, body for writes) and exposes new optional `HttpRouteDefinition.inputSchema` + `layerInputProjections` for surface adapters / OpenAPI generators. Collision rule matches TRL-473's: deterministic rename to a layer-prefixed camelCase name with the original captured in the routing table. Side fix: MCP and HTTP handlers now forward `topoLayers: graph.layers` + `surfaceLayers: layers` so topo-scope layers actually compose at runtime (previously the handlers used the deprecated `layers` alias and never read `graph.layers`).

### Patch Changes

  - @ontrails/core@1.0.0-beta.14

## 1.0.0-beta.13

### Minor Changes

- Trail-native vocabulary cutover. Breaking API field renames across all packages:

  - Trail spec: `run:` → `blaze:`, `follow:` → `crosses:`, `services:` → `provisions:`, `metadata:` → `meta:`, `emits:` → `signals:`
  - Runtime: `ctx.follow()` → `ctx.cross()`, `ctx.emit()` → `ctx.signal()`, `ctx.signal` (abort) → `ctx.abortSignal`
  - Entry points: `blaze(app)` → `trailhead(app)`
  - Package rename: `@ontrails/crumbs` → `@ontrails/tracker`
  - Wrapper types: `Layer` → `Gate`, `layers`/`middleware` → `gates`
  - Transport: `surface` → `trailhead`, `adapter` → `connector`

### Patch Changes

- 6944147: Complete trifecta for config, permits, and tracker (formerly tracks)

  - **config**: Add `configProvision`, `configGate`, `config.trail`, and `config.workspace` trails with full `defineConfig`, `resolve`, `describe`, `explain`, `doctor`, and code generation support

## 1.0.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- Add provisions as a first-class primitive.

  Provisions make infrastructure dependencies declarative, injectable, and governable. Define a provision with `provision()`, declare it on a trail with `provisions: [db]`, and access it with `db.from(ctx)` or `ctx.provision()`.

  **Core:** `provision()` factory, `ProvisionSpec<T>`, `ProvisionContext`, singleton resolution in `executeTrail`, in-flight creation dedup, `isProvision` guard, `findDuplicateProvisionId`, topo provision discovery and validation, `provisions` field on trail specs.

  **Testing:** Auto-resolution of `mock` factories in `testAll`, `testExamples`, `testContracts`, and `testCrosses`. Explicit `provisions` overrides with correct precedence (`explicit > ctx.extensions > auto-mock`). Provision mock propagation through crossing graphs.

  **Warden:** `provision-declarations` rule validates `db.from(ctx)` and `ctx.provision()` usage matches declared `provisions: [...]`. `provision-exists` rule validates declared provision IDs resolve in project context. Scope-aware AST walking skips nested function boundaries.

  **Trailheads:** Provision overrides thread through `run` and `trailhead` on CLI, MCP, and HTTP.

  **Introspection:** Survey and trailhead map outputs include provision graph. Topo exposes `.provisions`, `.getProvision()`, `.hasProvision()`, `.listProvisions()`, `.provisionIds()`, `.provisionCount`.

  **Docs:** ADR-009 accepted. Unified provisions guide, updated vocabulary, getting-started, architecture, and package READMEs.

## 1.0.0-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- Cleanup and hardening pass across all packages.

  **core**: Deduplicate `DispatchOptions` as type alias of `ExecuteTrailOptions`. Replace `TrailContext` index signature with typed `extensions` field for type safety. Deep-merge `extensions` in `executeTrail` context resolution. Remove unused `Trailhead` type, `connectors.ts`, `health.ts`, and `job.ts` proof-of-concept from published package.

  **cli**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `trailhead()` with opt-out via `validate: false`.

  **http**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `trailhead()` with opt-out.

  **mcp**: Remove vestigial `kind` checks from build. Run `validateTopo()` automatically in `trailhead()` with opt-out.

  **warden**: Project-aware rule context preserved in trail wrappers.

- Updated dependencies
  - @ontrails/core@1.0.0-beta.10

## 1.0.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- Consolidated improvements across all trailhead packages.

  **core**: Add `TrailResult<T>` utility type, `topo.ids()` and `topo.count` accessors, `run()` for headless trail execution, and extract shared `executeTrail` pipeline used by CLI/MCP/HTTP.

  **http**: Detect route path collisions and return `Result` from `buildHttpRoutes()`, wire request `AbortSignal` through to trail context, and make write → POST mapping explicit in intent-to-method lookup.

  **mcp**: Return `Result` from `buildMcpTools()` on collision instead of throwing.

  **cli**: Verify exception catching via centralized `executeTrail`.

  **testing**: Cross-context awareness improvements.

  **warden**: Refactor rules as composable trails with examples.

  **schema**: Error code and empty body fixes.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- Bug fixes across all trailhead packages found via parallel Codex review.

  **core**: Fix Result.toJson false circular detection on DAGs, deserializeError subclass round-trip, topo cross-kind ID collisions, validateTopo multi-node cycle detection, error example input validation bypass, and deriveFields array type collapse.

  **cli**: Switch trailhead to parseAsync for proper async error handling, add boolean flag negation (--no-flag), and strict number parsing that rejects partial input.

  **mcp**: Align BlobRef with core (including ReadableStream support) and detect tool-name collisions after normalization.

  **testing**: Include hikes in testContracts validation, with cross-context awareness.

  **warden**: Collect hike detour targets, validate detour refs in hike specs, and stop implementation-returns-result from walking into nested function bodies.
